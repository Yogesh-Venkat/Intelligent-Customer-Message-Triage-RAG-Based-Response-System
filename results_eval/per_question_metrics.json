If the repair fails, a full refund or exchange is issued. Therefore, the very first step required is an on-site service repair attempt.\n*   **For the Smart Refrigerator (AP-FRZ-100):** Orders for large appliances, like the Smart Refrigerator, are subject to a $150 cancellation fee if canceled after the delivery window has been scheduled.",
