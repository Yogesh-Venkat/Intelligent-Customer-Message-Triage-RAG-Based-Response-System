Check your spam folder if the Order Confirmation is missing after 30 minutes.AP-002: Cancellation and Restocking FeesOrders for small electronics (IoT devices, accessories) can be canceled within 2 hours. Large appliances (SKUs beginning with AP-) are subject to a $150 cancellation fee if canceled after the delivery window has been scheduled, due to associated logistics costs. Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days.AP-003: 60-Day Return and Repair PolicySmall electronics are eligible for a 60-day return in original condition. Large appliances are covered by a 30-day return window but are first subject to an on-site service repair attempt. If the repair fails, a full refund or exchange is issued. All returns require an RMA number generated via the Returns Portal.AP-004: Standard and Extended Warranty CoverageAll products carry a standard 1-year manufacturer warranty. You may purchase an extended 3-year warranty for an additional 15% of the product price.

It requires a dedicated 15A circuit. Dimensions are 36" W x 70" H x 32" D. Power consumption is rated at $450\text{ kWh}/\text{year}$. The water filter (Part: FRZ-WF-03) should be replaced every 6 months. It has two separate compressors for freezer and fridge sections, ensuring energy efficiency. The advanced diagnostics feature is accessible via the service menu (code: 4792).PR-402: Detailed Specifications: Smart Washing Machine (AP-WSH-200)This machine has a 5.0 cu. ft. capacity, a steam sanitize function, and is Energy Star certified. It requires a 240V dedicated outlet. Installation Note: Must be installed level; improper leveling causes excessive vibration and is not covered under the standard warranty. The self-cleaning cycle should be run monthly using a machine cleaning tablet. The drum spins at a maximum of $1200\text{ RPM}$.PR-403: Detailed Specifications: Smart Thermostat 300 (TH-SMT-300)The Thermostat supports conventional (G, Y, W, R) and heat pump systems. It requires a C-wire connection for constant power. It supports geofencing and smart scheduling via the mobile application. The ambient temperature sensor has an accuracy of $\pm 0.5^\circ \text{C}$. It has a physical lock screen feature accessible by pressing and holding the main dial for 10 seconds.PR-404: Payment Methods and Secure LinksWe accept Visa, Mastercard, American Express, and Affirm Financing (for purchases over $500). The secure payment portal for all transactions is secure.home-essentials.com/payment. The full catalog is available at home-essentials.com/products. Affirm Financing offers plans up to 36 months, subject to credit check.Section 3: Technical Troubleshooting and Setup (TS) - Highly ExpandedTS-101: Initial Setup for Smart Thermostat 300Before installation, turn off power at the breaker. The TH-SMT-300 requires a C-wire connection. Once wired, download the 'HomeCentral' app and select 'New Device Setup'. The thermostat will broadcast a temporary setup Wi-Fi network that your phone must connect to before connecting to your home network.TS-102: Troubleshooting Connectivity (CAM-SEC-V2)If the IoT Security Camera fails to connect (flashing red LED), verify your Wi-Fi uses the 2.4 GHz band. Check your router settings to ensure MAC filtering is disabled. The camera requires TCP ports 80 and 443 to be open for cloud communication. If the issue persists, perform a hard reset by holding the pairing button for 15 seconds.TS-103: API Access for Home AutomationDevelopers can integrate using the REST API. Authentication requires an API Key sent in the header as X-API-KEY. The endpoint for device status is /api/v1/device/status/{device_id}. Rate limiting is set at 100 requests per minute; exceeding this limit will trigger an HTTP 429 error. For API documentation, see developer.home-essentials.com/docs.TS-104: Troubleshooting Multi-Floor Mapping (VAC-ROBO-1)The Smart Vacuum Bot can store up to 3 distinct floor maps. If mapping fails: 1. Ensure the device starts from the base station on the correct floor. 2. Clear previous corrupted maps via the app settings menu ("Map Management"). 3. Avoid moving the base station during the initial mapping run to prevent Lidar occlusion errors. Lidar requires a clear line of sight.TS-105: Diagnostics for AP-WSH-200 Excessive VibrationExcessive vibration is usually caused by shipping bolts that were not removed or uneven installation. 1. Check Bolts: Remove the four large shipping bolts at the rear of the machine. 2. Check Leveling: Adjust the four leveling feet until the appliance is perfectly level ($\pm 1^\circ$). If the issue continues, contact the technical hotline.TS-106: Cloud Video Retrieval Failure (CAM-SEC-V2)If you cannot retrieve cloud video: 1. Verify your SUB-CAMS-PREM subscription is active. 2. Check the camera's Wi-Fi signal strength (must be above 70% in the app diagnostics). 3. If local storage is installed, attempt local retrieval to isolate the issue.TS-107: Smart Dishwasher Error Code E05 (Water Intake Failure)Error E05 indicates the dishwasher is not receiving adequate water pressure or volume. 1. Check the water inlet hose for kinks or blockages. 2. Ensure the shut-off valve beneath the sink is fully open. 3. If both are clear, the intake solenoid valve may be faulty, requiring a service request (home-essentials.com/service-request).TS-108: Dehumidifier CLM-DEH-10 MaintenanceThe Mini Dehumidifier (CLM-DEH-10) requires the water tank to be emptied when the 'Full' indicator light turns blue. The air filter should be cleaned monthly with warm soapy water and allowed to dry completely before reinstallation. Failure to clean the filter reduces dehumidifying efficiency by up to 40%.Section 4: Finance, Billing, and Compliance (BA)BA-201: Affirm Financing DetailsAffirm financing offers payment plans from 3 to 36 months, subject to credit check. Annual Percentage Rates (APR) range from $0\%$ to $30\%$. You can pre-qualify without affecting your credit score at home-essentials.com/affirm-prequal.BA-202: Invoice Retrieval and Audit RequirementsInvoices are permanently stored in the customer portal. W-9 and VAT documents are available upon request via email to accounts@home-essentials.com. Transaction records are retained for 7 years for financial compliance.BA-203: Subscription Dunning ProcessIf payment for a subscription (e.g., SUB-CAMS-PREM) fails on the 5th of the month, automatic retries occur on the 8th and 12th. If the third attempt fails, the service is suspended on the 13th. Service is restored immediately upon successful payment via the renewal link.BA-204: Refund Calculation ProtocolRefunds for appliances (AP- series) are calculated as: Purchase Price - ($150 Installation Fee) - ($50 Removal Fee, if applicable) - (Any restocking fee if damage is present).BA-205: Data Deletion Policy for Smart DevicesUpon request for data deletion (via home-essentials.com/privacy), all personal data associated with device usage is purged from our servers within 45 days.
